                        first web page with HTML and css. While i was studying in University I took computer science as my major subject
                        and was introduced to programming. During my studies I am an active classroom officers and became an active and responsible
                        for all kinds of tasks and projects.

                                 I am highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member of ateam. I specially enjoy 
                        working with changing Projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high presision.
                        I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
